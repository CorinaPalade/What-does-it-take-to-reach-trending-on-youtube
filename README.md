### Introduction and Motivation  <a name="introduction"></a>
This repository contains the code that I have used in order to find out what it takes to reach trending on YouTube in different regions. I tried to answer the following questions:

1. What categories are the most common in Trending on YouTube in different countries?
2. What is the relationship between the number of views and the number of likes/dislikes/comments? Is the number of likes influencing the number of view the same as the number of dislikes? Could we predict the number of views knowing the number of likes, dislikes and comments of a video?
3. Are the same channels trending often?
4. How old are the videos in trending usually?

### Installation  <a name="installation"></a>
After cloning the repository, you will have the notebook on your computer and the dataset. The code should run now successfully when using Python3.

### Files Description  <a name="description"></a>
The repository is containing only the notebook file. Inside the file we can find the code that I used in order to extract data from the dataset.

### Results  <a name="results"></a>
The conclusions reached after performing the analysis can be found [here](https://medium.com/@corina.palade103/what-does-it-take-to-reach-trending-on-youtube-bb5589c2689d).
